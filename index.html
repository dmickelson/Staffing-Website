          Black Diamond’s relational business approach is centered on our customer service philosophy.  Our dedicated account managers develop an intimate understanding of each customer’s business and how to successfully recruit for and fulfill its temporary technical staffing needs.

          We are not only interested in the effective execution of the front end of the service process, which involves candidate sourcing and delivery but, equally focused on ensuring a quality outcome to the assignment.  Once a Black Diamond contractor has started his or her assignment, Black Diamond’s Contractor and Client Service Team steps in with regular follow up to the contractor and the client to make sure that both parties are satisfied and everything is in place to have a successful assignment. These programs were established to provide an enhanced level of service support for our contractors and customer managers we serve. Our goal is to work with you to ensure you gain optimum value from our services and contractors.
