      In today’s technology age, businesses are challenged more than ever to keep up, if not stay ahead, of the latest tech trends and developments. As companies continue to migrate social media into their enterprises and integrate an IT SaaS model into their business strategies, technology will be increasingly more important.
      Major advancements in consumer-based technology, like mobile applications and cloud computing, continue to reshape the way business operates, often causing companies to struggle with how to procure top IT talent to meet their customer demands and business objectives.
